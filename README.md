# Andrew-Keen-Final-cpp-Project
A program that allows users to play Mad Libs on a computer. It contains four games from Sooper Dooper Mad Libs, and more could easily be added.
The program starts by asking the user to choose game 1, 2, 3, or 4. When the us enters a number corresponding to a game, it asks the user for the words needed to fill out the game, and stores the words in an array. Then it outputs the full paragraph with the words filled in, and returns to the choose a game menu. Each game is in a funcion so the variables reset, and so that more games can easily be added.
